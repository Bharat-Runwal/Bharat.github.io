                              <h2>Image Steganography</h2>
                              <p>This project is a developed as a part of a Course <em>Singals and Systems</em>.Steganography is a technique
                              of hiding secret data within an ordinary non-secret file or message to avoid any detection, the secret data is then
                              extracted at its destination.It can be used to conceal almost any type of digital content including text,image ,video or
                              audio content etc.Here i have done Image steganography i.e. embedding secret message in an image.</p>
                              <p>There are several ways in which this can be done i have used Least significant bit method.Also,to increase the security of
                              message a bit encryption method is also used.</p>

                                  <h2>Implementaion of Student Database System </h2>
                                  <p>Implemented a student database which stores wealth of information about a student –first name, last name , hostel ,
                                  department , grades etc. The database is heavily loaded each year due to some reasons like: new admissions , 
                                  updating grades of each student etc.</p>
                                  <p>Hash table implementation is used for this purpose , in this implementation we have to deal with the problem of 
                                  collisions so this project uses two techniques for collision resolution : Double hashing , Separate chaining using Binary search trees.</p>
