                           <h2>Hand-written digit Recognition</h2>
                           <p>Automated handwritten digit
recognition is widely used today - from recognizing zip codes (postal codes)
on mail envelopes to recognizing amounts written on bank checks.A neural network is implemented to recognize handwritten digits using the given training set .The neural
network will be able to represent complex models that form non-linear hypotheses.</p><p>The backpropagation algorithm
is used to learn the parameters for the neural network.</p><p>The feedforward propagation and the parameters learned from backpropagation algorithm are used to predict handwritten digits.</p>
  <p>With lambda=1 and Iterations = 400 
Network acheives 99.52% accuracy </p>
                <p> For implementation and documentation,<a href="https://github.com/Bharat-Runwal/Machine-Learning/tree/master/Hand-written%20digit%20recognition" class="link "target="_blank" alt="View on Github">view this project on GitHub</a></p>

                           <h2>Spam-Classification</h2>
                           <p>Many email services today provide spam filters that are able to classify emails
into spam and non-spam email with high accuracy. This project will use SVMs to build spam filter.</p><p>Firstly all the emails are preprocessed according to given examples and then suitable normalization steps are taken like:- Lower-casing,Stripping HTML,Normalizing URLs,Word Stemming etc.</p>
       <p>A Vocabulary list is selected by choosing all words which occur at least a 100 times in the spam corpus,
               resulting in a list of words.This list help in extracting features from Email.</p><p>The classifier gets a training accuracy
of about 99.8% and a test accuracy of about 98.5%.
                             </p>

                           <h2>Image Steganography</h2>
                           <p>Steganography is a technique of hiding secret data within an ordinary non-secret file or message to avoid any detection, the secret data is then
                              extracted at its destination.It can be used to conceal almost any type of digital content including text,image ,video or
                              audio content etc.Here i have done Image steganography i.e. embedding secret message in an image.</p>
                              <p>There are several ways in which this can be done i have used Least significant bit method.Also,to increase the security of
                              message a bit encryption method is also used.</p>

               <div><h2>Implementaion of Student Database System </h2>
                                  <p>Implemented a student database which stores wealth of information about a student–first name,last name,hostel,department,grades etc.The database is heavily loaded each year due to some reasons like: new admissions,updating grades of each student etc.</p>
                                  <p>Hash table implementation is used for this purpose,in this implementation we have to deal with the problem of collisions so this project uses two techniques for collision resolution: Double hashing,Separate chaining using Binary search trees.</p>
