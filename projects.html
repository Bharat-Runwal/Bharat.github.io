                           <div class='set'>
                           <p>Sentiment extraction from a text nowadays is quite popular, like from building Q&A chatbots
                           to identifying  bias related issue (regarding caste,colour etc.) from text.There are many different
                         models build for this task initially it was Naive Bayes(which just do counting and is not good for sentiment analysis) then now most popular one LSTM.</p>
                         <p>Dataset comprises of 160,0000 Tweets labeled with 0 and 1 in sense of sentiment related to it , The data is available on <em>Kaggle</em>.To get a better sense of sentiment attached to given tweet GloVe is used which gives us a Embedding Matrix for different words representation in higher dimensions.A Sequential model of LSTM network with Convolutions is trained on given dataset.
                          <p>Training on whole(160,0000 tweets)dataset takes a long time on my laptop because of not so 
                          good spec.<em> :( </em>,so i trained it on 500,000 tweets and used a validation set of 5000 examples and it acheives nearly 77% accuracy on validation set. We can still improve the performance by training on a much bigger dataset.</p>

                           <p>Many email services today provide spam filters that are able to classify emails

       <p>A Vocabulary list is selected by choosing all words which occur at least a 100 times in the spam corpus,
               resulting in a list of words.This list help in extracting features from Email.</p><p>The classifier gets a training accuracy
of about 99.8% and a test accuracy of about 98.5%.

                           <p>Steganography is a technique of hiding secret data within an ordinary non-secret file or message to avoid any detection, the secret data is then
                              extracted at its destination.It can be used to conceal almost any type of digital content including text,image ,video or
                              audio content etc.Here i have done Image steganography i.e. embedding secret message in an image.</p>
                              <p>There are several ways in which this can be done i have used Least significant bit method.Also,to increase the security of
                              message a bit encryption method is also used.</p>
